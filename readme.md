AE Viewer is a project built around bing able to view (and maybe in the future also modify) your AE-system. The repository you are looking at is the frontent website.

## Backend

Currently, the backend is a bit of computercraft code that can be downloaded by executing:

    patebin get zrB1QDsY updateAEViewer

You will also need the computercraft JSON api:

    pastebin get 4nRg9CHU json

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, you can simply fork this project. If you cannot code but have some ideas, please post them in the bug tracker.

## Security Vulnerabilities

We are currently aware of a few vulnerabilities on the in-game end of this project. We are working out a fix (which is likely going to involve a separate mod). Before deploying on public servers, please await this.

If you find any critical security vulnerabilities that directly affect the security of either the "official" production server or anyone specific in person. Please notify me immediately so it can be fixed as fast as possible.

If you want to upload your own version of this website, I would appreciate if you notified me (just out of interest).
