                        <p>Fist you need to make sure you have enabled the HTTP API in the computercraft config file. (It should be enabled by default.) Then place a computer next to any AE network component (a wire, controller, storage monitor, anything) and start it up.</p>
                        <p>You can download the computercraft program by entering the following command:</p>
                        <p>
                            <code>pastebin get zrB1QDsY startup</code><br>
                            <code>pastebin get 4nRg9CHU json</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then simply open the program by entering:</p>
                        <p>
                            <code>
                                edit startup
                            </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>and enter your credentials. After that, simply start the program by typing: </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>
                                startup

                            It is now possible to contribute! This project is hosted on github at <a href="https://github.com/rhbvkleef/AEViewer">rhbvkleef/AEViewer</a>. There, you can either fork the repository and modify the code yourself, or you can create an issue and let someone else modify the code for you (which is perfectly acceptable).

                        There are currently a few security flaws in the way this program works.
                        <p>
                            As you may have noticed, you need to enter your login password in plaintext on your computercraft computer. This is obviously very insecure. I have a few very elaborate ways to fix it, but I am sure your ideas must be much better. Again: Please email them to <a href="mailto:rhbvkleef+aeviewer@gmail.com">rhbvkleef+aeviewer@gmail.com</a> or create an issue on the github page <a href="https://github.com/rhbvkleef/AEViewer">rhbvkleef/AEViewer</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On server side, your password is stored in a secure hashed format: I do not, and cannot know your password. I will not publish the specific crypto I am using, but rest assured it is going to take until the end of the universe to crack it. This does not mean you should do any of the following:
                            <ul class="list-group">
                                <ul class="list-group-item">Use weak passwords</ul>
                                <ul class="list-group-item">Reuse passwords</ul>
                                <ul class="list-group-item">Publish passwords</ul>
                                <ul class="list-group-item">Store passwords in plaintext on your computer</ul>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
